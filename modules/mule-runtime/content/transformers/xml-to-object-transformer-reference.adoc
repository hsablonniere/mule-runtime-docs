You can use an XML-to-Object transformer to transform XML data to a Java Object (also referred to as Java Bean graphs) using XStream.

Minimum Configuration: The name of the XStream driver class.

An XML-to-Object transformer transforms XML data using the specified XStream driver class.

*Important*: Mule uses XStream 1.4.2. The XML-to-object transformer is vulnerable to link:http://www.securityfocus.com/bid/64760[CVE-2013-7285]. A remote attacker can send messages to an XML-to-object transformer and can achieve remote code execution (RCE). For more information, contact link:http://www.mulesoft.com/support-and-services/mule-esb-support-license-subscription[MuleSoft Customer Support.]   

In addition to the properties common to all transformers, you can also specify class aliases and converters.

*Tabs*:

* *General* -  Specify or browse to the XStream driver class:

* *Advanced* - Optionally configure the properties standard to all transformers, plus add or change class aliases and class converters.

** Use the *Aliases* pane to create, edit, or delete aliases for specific classes. 
** Use the *Converters* pane to create, edit, or delete class converters.
