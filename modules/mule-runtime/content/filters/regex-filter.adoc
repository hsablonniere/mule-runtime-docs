*Purpose:* Matches string messages against a regular expression.

*Minimum Configuration:* The pattern string for the match.

*Discussion:* The RegEx Filter applies a link:http://www.regular-expressions.info/[regular expression] pattern, such as a pattern that includes wildcards or other character substitution symbols, to the message payload. The filter applies the `toString()` method to the payload to convert the payload to a String. To ensure that the payload is a String, you might want to apply a Payload Filter to the message with a nested And Logic Filter.
