Components are message processors which execute link:http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_logic[business logic] on messages. They enable you to perform specific actions without writing any Mule-specific code. You can drop a component – a POJO, Spring bean, Java bean, or script – into a flow to perform almost any customized task within your Mule application. For example, you can use a component to verify that items on an invoice are in stock in a warehouse, or to update a database with a customer's order history. 

== Scripting Components

Mule includes several *scripting components* that you can use in flows to execute custom business logic. These components enable you to drop a chunk of custom-written logic into your flow to act upon messages.

The example below illustrates the use of a Groovy script component. The script uses the value of `state` to determine which of four sales regions to assign a lead.

== Web Service Components

Also included are two components to facilitate *exposing, consuming, and proxying Web services.* The CXF component leverages the CXF framework Mule uses to support SOAP Web services; the REST component works with Jersey to support RESTful Web services; both are bound to HTTP.

[TIP]
*APIkit* offers a new and improved way of building a REST API. Access the xref:apikit@3.8.3::about-apikit#[APIkit Documentation] to learn how to build REST APIs in a few hours or days.

== HTTP Static Resource Handler

Further, Mule provides an HTTP static resource handler to facilitate working with calls over HTTP. Use the *HTTP Static Resource Handler* to easily serve up static content when called.

== Other Building Blocks Grouped Under Components

Finally, Mule includes several other building blocks designed to meet rather specific needs.

* Use a *Logger component* to log activities in the flow as they occur. 
* Use an *Expression component* to evaluate a particular expression upon a message in a flow.
* Use an *Invoke* component to invoke the method of an object specified with a Mule expression.
* Use an *Echo component* to return the payload of a message as a call response.
* Use a *Flow Reference component* to access another flow from within a flow.
* Use a *Batch Execute* component to kick off processing of a batch job.

=== HTTP Listen and Choose

In the following example, you can try different values from this URL:

http://localhost:8081/?choice=<value>

If you enter *choice=mules*, the flow succeeds and returns a status of 200 (okay); otherwise any other value returns a choice of null and a status code of 400 (bad request).
