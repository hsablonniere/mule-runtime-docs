The following changes have been made to schemas within Mule 3.0.Â  For details on the schemas themselves, consult the xref:mule-configuration/schema-documentation#[schemadoc] added with Mule 3.0.

== Core Mule

* The `synchronous` attribute has been removed in favor of the xref:endpoints/endpoint-configuration-reference#[exchange-pattern] attribute.
* xref:endpoints/endpoint-configuration-reference#[Dynamic endpoints] can be designated on most transports.
* Transformers, routers, filters, and other constructs that affect the processing of messages are now all Message Processors and can be used more flexibly inside a Mule configuration.

== BPM

* xref:modules/bpm-module-reference#[BPM] now includes the element `jbpm-connector` to specify a jBpm connector.

== CXF

* The CXF schema is quite different now that CXF has been changed from a transport to a module. For details, see Upgrading CXF from Mule 2.

== E-mail

* The e-mail connectors (xref:transports/imap-transport-reference#[IMAP], xref:transports/imap-transport-reference#[IMAPS], xref:transports/pop3-transport-reference#[POP3], and xref:transports/pop3-transport-reference#[POP3S]) support a new attribute `moveToFolder`, which specifies a folder to move e-mail messages to after they have been read.

== File

* The legacy filename parser, used for Mule 1 compatibility, has been removed. The expression filename parser is now the default.

== HTTP

* The xref:transports/deprecated-http-transport-reference#[HTTP transport] defines a new transformer element `body-to-parameter-map-transformer`, which transforms the body of an HTTP message into a map.
* HTTP outbound endpoints now have the boolean attribute `follow-redirects`, which applies to HTTP GETs only.

== JMS

* xref:transports/jms-transport-reference#[JMS] connectors have the new boolean attribute `embeddedMode`, which tells Mule to avoid using certain JMS features.

== Management

* In the xref:administer/jmx-management#[Management module], the element `jmx-server` now takes the boolean attribute `createRmiRegistry`, which specifies whether to create an RMI registry if none exists.

== Quartz

* xref:transports/quartz-transport-reference#[Quartz] endpoints have a new boolean attribute `stateful`, which determines whether the current job is peristent.

== Servlet

* Inbound and global xref:transports/servlet-transport-reference#[Servlet] endpoints have a new attribute `path`, which specifies the path of the servlet to bind to.

== TCP

* A custom implementation for the xref:transports/tcp-transport-reference#[TCP] protocol can now be specified as a reference to a Spring bean.

== VM

* The connector no longer takes the attribute `queueEvents`. Queuing behavior is now determined by the endpoint's exchange pattern.

== XML

* The xref:modules/xml-module-reference#[XML] now includes JAXB and xref:modules/xquery-support#[XQuery Support] transformers and extensions.
* The `xml-to-object-transformer` element can now be further configured to customize XStream behavior.
